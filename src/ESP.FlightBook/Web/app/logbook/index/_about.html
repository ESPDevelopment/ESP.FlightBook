                <p class="p-lg">ESP Development is an on-going project that connects my passion for flying with my passion for coding.  ESP FlightBook is my latest effort to move my physical logbook data online.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">How many times have you had to go to your physical logbook in order to calculate such things as time in a particular aircraft, flight hours over the last 30, 60, or 90 days, or just to see how far you are from your next flying milestone?  That’s happened to me more than once and hopefully for the last time.  After all, computers do their best work doing such rote things as adding up numbers and slicing those numbers by various categories.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">I’m a general aviation pilot – private pilot, instrument rated, not an airline pilot.  Thus ESP FlightBook is designed for and targeted to the general aviation pilot.  Thus, the features and capabilities that will be added will be more aligned to the more basic needs of general aviation pilots.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">ESP FlightBook will allow me, and thus you, to enter your flying time and view your flying statistic from any web-enabled device.  It takes time and effort to record such information and losing valuable data simply isn’t an option.  You can rest assured that ESP FlightBook will take the steps necessary to protect your data from data loss and to secure your data from unauthorized access.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">I hope you enjoy ESP FlightBook as much as I enjoy building and maintaining it.  Feel free to send me feedback at any time.</p>
